# large structure changes
- make a style that is Q&A for about me and important notes
- add google sheets API to the CV so anytime im editing the CV on google sheets it automatically updates to the website

## sub tasks
google sheets API 
- need to reformat the google sheets to follow the structure of the website i have rn (THE SUPER BIG TASK ARGHHHH)
- connect with API and learn how it works then do the rest

# small ideas
- add links to about me that has embed popup that allows the user to clicks into and opens new page
	- ie. I am in Langara rn, when in about me, hovering over the Lanagara text, the embed of hinted website pop up will appear
- add transitions to buttons for when hovered over to add interactivity
- too many projects, so make it gallery scroll or add hyperlink to project page
	- ie. see all (projects)
- create a cursor design that follows or replaces the cursor when on the website

## design
